# Application Security Risk Assessment Framework

This repository provides a practical, end-to-end framework for evaluating application security risk, third-party/vendor risk, and compliance alignment. It is organized to mirror real-world governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) workflows used by security teams.

The goal is to support:

- Application security risk assessments
- Third-party and vendor risk reviews
- Compliance alignment with standards such as HIPAA, SOC 2, PCI-DSS, NIST, and ISO 27001
- Basic automation using Python for risk scoring and reporting

## Repository Structure

- `01_Assessment_Templates/`  
  Templates for application risk assessments, vendor reviews, cloud security checklists, data classification, and threat modeling.

- `02_Sample_Assessments/`  
  Completed example assessments showing how to document risk, score likelihood and impact, and write executive-ready findings.

- `03_Framework_Mappings/`  
  Mapping documents that relate common frameworks, such as HIPAA to NIST 800-53 or SOC 2 to ISO 27001.

- `04_GRC_Automation_Scripts/`  
  Small Python scripts to automate risk scoring, compare vendor questionnaire responses, and generate basic risk heatmaps.

- `05_Policies_And_Procedures/`  
  Example policies and procedures for application security, third-party risk management, secure SDLC, and app-focused incident response.

- `06_Training_Guides/`  
  Short guides that explain how to perform app risk assessments, use OSINT as a risk analyst, and run basic threat modeling workshops.

- `07_Healthcare_Security/`  
  Healthcare-specific examples focused on HIPAA, PHI, and Business Associate Agreement (BAA) security expectations.

## How to Use This Repository

1. Start with the templates in `01_Assessment_Templates/` to structure your own assessments.
2. Review `02_Sample_Assessments/` to see how findings and recommendations can be documented.
3. Use the framework mappings in `03_Framework_Mappings/` to connect risks and controls to standards and regulations.
4. Run the scripts in `04_GRC_Automation_Scripts/` to experiment with basic automation.
5. Adapt any policies, procedures, and guides to fit your own environment or learning goals.

This project is a learning and demonstration tool, especially for governance, risk, and compliance roles focused on application and vendor security.
