# How to Conduct an Application Security (AppSec) Risk Assessment
A practical, step-by-step guide for new analysts, developers, and security professionals.

This guide explains how to perform an application security risk assessment from start to finish. It is written to be clear, structured, and actionable — suitable for onboarding, internal training, and personal reference.

# 1. Overview

An Application Security Risk Assessment helps identify, evaluate, and prioritize security risks in applications so that vulnerabilities can be addressed before they impact the business. This includes:

- understanding what the application does  
- identifying sensitive data involved  
- analyzing architecture and data flows  
- identifying threats and vulnerabilities  
- scoring likelihood and impact  
- documenting findings and recommending mitigation actions  

This guide walks you through the standard workflow used by GRC, AppSec, and cybersecurity risk teams.

# 2. Step-by-Step Assessment Process

## **Step 1: Gather Context**
Before testing or evaluating security, gather essential information:

- Application name and purpose  
- Business owner and technical owner  
- Hosting model (on-prem, cloud, hybrid)  
- Data classification (PHI, PII, PCI, internal, public)  
- User groups (internal users, customers, vendors)  
- Key integrations with other systems  
- Regulatory requirements (HIPAA, PCI, GDPR, etc.)  

This helps establish the “risk surface.”

## **Step 2: Review Architecture & Data Flow**
Request or create:

- system architecture diagram  
- data flow diagram (DFD)  
- authentication & authorization model  
- encryption approach  
- network exposure (internet-facing, internal-only)  

Questions to ask:

- How does data move through the system?  
- Where is sensitive data stored?  
- Which components interact with external systems?  
- What security controls protect each step?  

---

## **Step 3: Identify Threats & Vulnerabilities**
Use structured threat models such as:

- STRIDE (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege)  
- OWASP Top 10 application vulnerabilities  
- MITRE ATT&CK techniques  

Evaluate potential issues:

- broken authentication  
- insecure access controls  
- injection risks  
- misconfigurations  
- insecure APIs  
- weak session management  
- missing encryption  
- insufficient logging  

Document each threat or vulnerability with:

- description  
- affected assets  
- potential impact  
- likelihood of exploitation  

---

## **Step 4: Evaluate Security Controls**
Assess the presence and maturity of key controls:

### Authentication & Access Control
- MFA required?
- SSO integrated?
- Role-based access with least privilege?

### Data Security
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2/1.3)?
- Encryption at rest?
- Key management?

### Logging & Monitoring
- Centralized logs?
- Alerts on suspicious behavior?
- Admin activity logging?

### Configuration & Hardening
- Baseline configuration?
- Patch management?
- Cloud security best practices?

Compare these controls to **NIST**, **HIPAA**, **SOC 2**, or internal policies.

---

## **Step 5: Score Likelihood & Impact**
Use a standard scoring rubric — usually a **1–5 scale**:

### Likelihood (1–5)
How easily can the threat be exploited?

### Impact (1–5)
If exploited, what is the consequence?

- PHI/PII exposure  
- service disruption  
- financial penalties  
- regulatory violations  
- reputational damage  

### Calculate Risk Score:
